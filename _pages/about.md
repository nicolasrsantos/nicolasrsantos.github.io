About Me
======
Hello! I'm a Postdoctoral Researcher in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of California, Riverside, where I'm mentored by [Prof. Vagelis Papalexakis](https://www.cs.ucr.edu/~epapalex/). My current work focuses on developing machine learning methods to address challenges in precision agriculture.

My broader research interests lie at the intersection of machine learning, graphs, and data mining. I'm particularly interested in developing techniques for the compression of large-scale data to improve the efficiency and scalability of AI models.

Prior to UCR, I completed my PhD in Computer Science and Computational Mathematics at the University of São Paulo, under [Prof. Alneu de Andrade Lopes](https://sites.icmc.usp.br/alneu/) where I developed graph reduction methods aimed at improving the efficiency and scalability of graph-based learning systems.
